# Problem

The devices that locate themselves via GPS and other sensors inside a building have GPS location jump issues due to low signal reception.

When the GPS location jumps occur, the user receives GeoFence violation notifications. 





This example application has been written to improve the indoor tracking capability of GPS devices while preventing / filtering wrong GPS data.

Android-Geohash library by Dmitry Romanov (drfonfon) has been used for this example application.
